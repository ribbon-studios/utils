## What is Utils?

Utils is all of your favorite unix tools made available via the web!

All of our implementations are client-side meaning none of your data leaves your machine!

## What happened to [utils.gg](https://github.com/salte-io/utils)?

This app is its successor! Due to the outdated codebase and numerous issues it <br/> had accrued I opted to port it to React and put it under my own organization.
